# S3-server

S3-server is a Rails server that responds to the same calls Amazon S3 responds to. It is extremely useful for testing of S3 in a sandbox environment without actually making calls to Amazon, which not only require network.

S3-server doesn't support all of the S3 command set, but the basic ones like put, get, list, copy, multipart uploads, and make bucket are supported. More coming soon.

## Running
```bash
$ bundle exec rails server -p 10001
```

- Running with docker

```bash
$ docker run -p 10001:10001 -d mdouchement/s3-server
```
